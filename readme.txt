Deactivate and hide all comments interface parts and features in WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin brings together several snippets to disable comments in WordPress that I found on the web. It is a form of recognition to all the developers who helped build this software.

It is recommended to install this plugin in the mu-plugins folder ("must-use plug-ins") in order to always run it before the common plug-ins.
