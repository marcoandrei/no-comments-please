A WordPress plugin that deactivates and hides all comments interface parts and features.


== Description ==

This plugin brings together several snippets to disable comments in WordPress that I found on the web. It is a form of recognition to all the developers who helped build this software.

It is recommended to install this plugin in the `mu-plugins` folder ("must-use plug-ins") in order to always run it before the common plug-ins.


== Installation ==
  
1. Upload the plugin folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.
2. Go to the **Plugins** page and activate the plugin.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
  
= How do I use this plugin? =
  
Just install, activate and that is it! All comments references in admin or frontend disappear.

= Where did the comments go?  =

= How to uninstall the plugin? =
  
Simply deactivate and delete the plugin. 


== Changelog ==

Avoid direct access. 

= 1.0 =
Initial release.
